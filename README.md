# About me
My name is Kasper Bilde and I live in Denmark with my spouse and our son.
I have a large interest in computational fluid dynamics which I've been using to
study particle-laden flows and turbulence. I strive to use open-source software
whenever it makes sense and is available.

## Education

2020-2022: PhD student at Aalborg University on particle agglomeration and breakage for fast sedimentation processes
onboard marine vessels using CFD-PBM.

2016-2018: M.Sc. in Thermal Energy and Process Engineering at Aalborg University.
Master's thesis on dynamic start-up of natural circulation boilers.

2013-2016: B.Sc. in Energy Engineering at Aalborg University

## Publications
