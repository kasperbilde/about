  summary: An issue was noted during start-up of the natural circulation boiler at Aalborg Energie Technik and I decided that I would try to model this issue during my Master's thesis. During warm start-up of the boiler, the evaporator was sometimes flooded with water and this model allowed to analyse the impact of various scenarios.
