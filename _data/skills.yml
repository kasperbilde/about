# Skills
# CFD
- skill: Computational fluid dynamics
  description: Throughout my PhD I have worked with computational fluid dynamics and the use of this method for various applications. I have mainly focused on particle-laden flows using a combination of CFD-DEM and CFD-PBE to predict particle aggregation.

# Cloud computing
- skill: Cloud computing
  description: Installing simulation software, users and maintaining a high-performance virtual machine in Microsoft Azure has been a skill I have learned over the past three years, as the R&D team needed such a solution.

# Digital twin
- skill: Digital twin modelling
  description: Creating a digital twin of a process or application is something that I always strive to achieve. Throughout my Master's project, various tasks as a R&D engineer and the research during my PhD, the focus has been on developing a digital twin for a system or application.
